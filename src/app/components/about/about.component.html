  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a front-end developer with a strong specialization in Angular and a deep passion for building user-centric, performant web applications. JavaScript has been at the core of my work for several years, and I continue to enjoy exploring its ever-evolving capabilities.</p>
  <p>My technical experience includes HTML, CSS, and preprocessors such as SCSS, SASS, and LESS. I'm also proficient with modern styling systems like Tailwind CSS and modular CSS. I am comfortable working in agile environments and following best practices in clean, maintainable code.</p>
  <p>Beyond development, I have successfully led teams and taken on client-facing roles. I have experience acting as a Scrum Master, facilitating communication and delivery across cross-functional teams.</p>
  <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have earned the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM-I) certification from Scrum.org. Currently, I am pursuing an executive course in Cloud Computing to expand my knowledge in scalable web infrastructure.</p>
  <p>I am actively seeking opportunities in Germany that value clean front-end architecture, team collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>
